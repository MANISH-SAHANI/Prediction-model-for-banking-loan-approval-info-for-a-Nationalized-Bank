### Project Title
Prediction-model-for-banking-loan-approval-info-for-a-Nationalized-Bank

### Project Description
**Project Objective & Brief** : Distribution of the loans is the core business part of almost every bank. The major portion of the bankâ€™s assets directly came from the profit earned from the loans distributed by the banks.

This is project one of the bank wanted to build a model to predict whether that particular applicantâ€™s loan can be approved or rejected.
